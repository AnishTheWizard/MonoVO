# Monocular Visual Odometry
### A Visual Odometry system composed of a single camera tracking its relative 3-D pose
#### MonoVO was implemented apart of a research project
#### This utilizes the following technologies
- FAST Corner Detection
- Lukas Kanade Optical Flow
- SVD to Recover Pose From Essential Matrix
- OpenCV Library
